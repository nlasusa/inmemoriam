            In Loving Memory of <div id="memName"> Kathy L. Vander Veur </div> <hr>
            <div id="memYears">Kathy L. Vander Veur was a cherished and dedicated member of the Kessler Topaz family for over two decades. She passed away on July 8, 2019, following a courageous battle with cancer. During her time with the Firm, Kathy served in many important administrative and creative roles, always bringing warmth and a deep sense of loyalty. She cared deeply about the Firm and its success, embodying a quiet strength that left a lasting impact.

                Kathy was a kind and empathetic soul with a special love for animals—especially horses—and a deep affection for her cat, Frodo. True to her private nature, she kept her illness and pain to herself, never seeking sympathy or wanting to be treated differently.
                
                Kathy will be dearly missed by her family, friends, and the many colleagues whose lives she touched.<br></div>
